# Solving linear optimization problems with ORTools

## Why?

CPLEX is too heavy (OrTools is only 25MB). It's not free (OrTools is free and open source). It's bloated with useless software (OrTools isn't). In order to use CPLEX you have to learn new languages and workflow where you could just use existing programming knowledge (OrTools is available for C++, Java, C# as well).

## How?

For Windows.

1. Install the [64Bit version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/).
2. Install ortools using pip `python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools`
3. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/chaklbdev/ortoolsexample.git`
4. Run it `python program.py`

For other systems: Check [official docs](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install).
